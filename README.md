FlightBookingSystem
===================

One of my courses' projects was to develop an airline booking system. This was done in collaboration with Joseph Khater. He was the one who pushed for colored texts and that really pushed the application to something special back in school. It has a small text file database and uses hashes to prevent modification of the database. There are videos on how to use the software in a 7zip file.
